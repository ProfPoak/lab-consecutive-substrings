Please add your pseudocode to this file

initialize combined array
store text length in length variable
    start for loop to iterate through each starting position
        start for loop to iterate through each ending position of the substrings
            use slice to extract sections of the string and store in substring variable
            push substring to combined array
return combined array

And a written explanation of your solution

This is a nested loop function because the use of slice requires a starting and end point.
Slice is the most efficient way to pull substrings from the text without having to transform the input.
The first loop tracks the starting position of where slice will pull the data. (i = 0)
The second loop tells slice where the end point is.(j = 1)
If the string input was "john", then the first substring slice would pull using the i and j variables would be "j".
This method uses brute force to check all possible combinations without taking shortcuts since ALL substrings must be found.
The time complexity is O(n^2) because each additional letter in the string creates a new starting point, and
adds a new end point to each previous start point.
This creates quadratic growth in time as the length of the string increases.
